Awoo
---

- Awoo is a chat framework providing both the server-side and client-side code.
- It uses RESTful to transfer data so that you can extend it to the webpages. 
- The server is based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and the local platform is based on [WPF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130(v=vs.110).aspx).
